# **doxx.net (BETA): Advanced VPN, Parallel Internet, and De-Location Platform**

**doxx.net** is a comprehensive privacy and security platform that combines a high-performance VPN service with a parallel Internet that includes location managment capabilities. The platform consists of two main components:
- **doxx.net client**: A stealth VPN and darknet service
- **API**: Creation of .doxx domains, create dns records, sign ssl certificates. 
- **Doxxulator**: Advanced location and browser emulation engine
- **WireGuard**: doxx.net has created it's own implmentation of WireGuard that is compatable with all WireGuard clients. 
- **a0x13 portal**: the https://a0x13.doxx.net portal is a web interface for managing your doxx.net network. 

### Together, these components provide:
- Parallel Internet
- Bypassing network restrictions and censorship
- Location spoofing and geo-unblocking
- Browser fingerprint manipulation
- Secure and private communication
- Services can operate entirely within the alternative internet
- No dependence on public domain registrars
- Immune to domain seizures or DNS blocking
- Resistant to deep packet inspection and traffic analysis
- No public footprint for internal services
- Complete isolation from internet-based attacks
- Granular control over access and permissions

### ðŸ”’ Enhanced Security
- Resistant to deep packet inspection
- AI based traffic analysis 
- Traffic analysis protection
- No public footprint for internal services
- Complete isolation from internet-based attacks
- Built-in dns protections for tracking, pixel tracking, and other annoying internet bullshit

*doxx.net is committed to advancing freedom of speech and open communication through innovative protocol design. By exposing the vulnerabilities and limitations in existing internet infrastructure, I aim to inspire the evolution of protocols that uphold the fundamental principle of unimpeded global connectivity. The internet was conceived as a tool for unrestricted communication, and my work underscores the need to preserve its open nature by breaking through barriers and empowering users to communicate freely, even in the face of censorship or restrictions.*


### **Key Features**
- **Crazy Transports:** Camouflage your connections as standard web traffic, evading deep packet inspection and network restrictions.  
- **Automatic Routing Management:** Intelligent routing adapts to network conditions, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.  
- **Static DARKNET IP Assignment:** Maintain consistent IP addresses on the darknet for stable and predictable connections. Doxx.net to the Internet egress IPs are not static.  
- **Certificate Pinning:** Enhanced security through strict certificate validation, mitigating man-in-the-middle attacks.  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Operates smoothly on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**, catering to a wide range of user environments.  
- **Cloudflare CDN Integration:** Utilize **Cloudflare's extensive CDN infrastructure** to further obfuscate your traffic, making it indistinguishable from legitimate web requests. 
- **Security Console:** Real-time visability across your tunnels.

Where most VPNs act more like a proxy, doxx.net is a true parallel internet. You can currently connect to the doxx.net network using either the propritary doxx.net client or a WireGuardÂ® client. Once connected, you can create your own private network infrastructure, operate services entirely within the alternative internet, and no dependence on public domain registrars.

It's pretty easy: You can use the a0x13.doxx.net portal to create your own private network infrastructure, or you can use the API to create your own private network infrastructure. The API is more for the hacker types where the portal is more for the average user.
