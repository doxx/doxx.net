## **Key Features**

- **Stealthy Transports:** Camouflage your connections as standard web traffic, evading deep packet inspection and network restrictions.  
- **Automatic Routing Management:** Intelligent routing adapts to network conditions, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.  
- **IPv4 and IPv6 Support:** Comprehensive IP compatibility for seamless connectivity across diverse networks.  
- **Static IP Assignment:** Maintain consistent IP addresses for stable and predictable connections.  
- **Certificate Pinning:** Enhanced security through strict certificate validation, mitigating man-in-the-middle attacks.  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Operates smoothly on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**, catering to a wide range of user environments.  
- **Cloudflare CDN Integration:** Utilize **Cloudflare's extensive CDN infrastructure** to further obfuscate your traffic, making it indistinguishable from legitimate web requests.

## üõ°Ô∏è **What is the Darknet?**
- The **Darknet** refers to a part of the internet not indexed by traditional search engines (like Google). It relies on **encrypted networks** to enable private communication and anonymous data sharing.
- It‚Äôs often misunderstood as being purely for illegal activities. In reality, it plays a **critical role in privacy, whistleblowing, bypassing censorship, and ensuring secure communication** in restrictive regions.

### **Why is the Darknet Important?**
- **Freedom of Speech:** Allows individuals to share information without fear of government persecution.
- **Bypassing Censorship:** Access information in countries with restricted internet.
- **Privacy Protection:** Securely communicate and share data without tracking.

## üåê **What is doxx.net:443 (Miami)
- tcp-encrypted.lax.us.doxx.net:443 (Los Angeles)

### HTTPS Servers
- https.mia.us.doxx.net:443 (Miami)
- https.lax.us.doxx.net:443 (Los Angeles)

### CDN-Protected Servers
- cdn.mia.us.doxx.net:443 (Miami)
- cdn.lax.us.doxx.net:443 (Los Angeles)


## üß© **Common Issues and Solutions**

**1. Connection Drops During SSH Sessions:**  
- Use the `-keep-established-ssh` flag to maintain active SSH connections.

**2. Routing Issues:**  
- Use `-no-routing` to manually control traffic routing:
```bash
./doxx.net -token YOUR_TOKEN -server cdn.mia.us.doxx.net:443 -type https -no-routing
ip route add x.x.x.x via 10.1.0.100
```

**3. Slow Speeds with CDN:**  
- Direct connections (`tcp-encrypted`) are often faster than using CDN.

**4. Server and -type missmatch:**  
- For https and cdn you must use -type https and for tcp-encrypted servers use -type tcp-encrypted.

**5. Disconnects and Crashes Causing Default route issues:** 
- If you are experiencing disconnects and crashes, you may need to readd the default route.


## Advanced Configuration

### Transport Types
- `tcp-encrypted`: Encrypted TCP with TLS
- `https`: HTTPS transport with compression

### Command Line Flags
```
Usage of ./bin/doxx.net-darwin-arm64:
  -debug
    	enable debug logging
  -kill
    	Remove default route instead of saving it
  -no-routing
    	Disable automatic routing
  -proxy string
    	Proxy URL (e.g., http://user:pass@host:port, https://user:pass@host:port, or socks5://user:pass@host:port)
  -server string
    	VPN server address (host:port)
  -token string
    	Authentication token
  -type string
    	Transport type (tcp-encrypted, or https) (default "tcp-encrypted")
```

## Technical Details

### Security Features

   - Custom packet framing
   - Optional compression for HTTPS transport

### Network Features

1. Packet Processing
   - 4-byte header for packet framing
   - MTU size validation
   - Special handling for latency-sensitive packets
   - IPv4 and IPv6 support

2. IP Management
   - Automatic IP address calculation
   - Static IP assignment
   - Prefix length determination
   - Automatic route management
